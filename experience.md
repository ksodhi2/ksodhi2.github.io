# Experience

## Verily (Google Life Sciences)
### Software Engineering Intern, Devices
#### May 2021 - Aug. 2021

Last Summer, I got the opportunity to join Verily as a Software Engineering Intern in the devices org. Specifically, I was placed on the team that is working on the [Study Watch](https://verily.com/solutions/study-watch/). 

For the first part of my internship, I worked on implementing features for an Android app that would allow it to connect to Verily's smartwatch, look for updates, and if applicable download an updated firmware image from the cloud and transfer it over to the watch. The app was built with Kotlin and communicated with the watch over usb using protocol buffers.

I spent the remaining portion of my time researching [TrustZone](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/security-ip/trustzone), a security feature for Arm Cortex processors, and developing embedded firmware to show how TrustZone could be used to securely read, write, and store cryptographic keys on the watch. 


## NetJets
### Software Engineering Intern, Crew Innovation Lab
#### June 2020 - Aug. 2020
I joined the Software Development team at NetJet's Crew Innovation Lab. We worked on improving and maintaining the all-encompassing mobile application flight crew used to view schedules, order food, scan passports and dozens of other things.

Most of my time was spent designing and implementing a way to automatically update discrepancies between passport data scanned from the crew's mobile app during flight boarding and what was stored in our database. I was able to update the appâ€™s back-end architecture using Grails, Groovy, and Java to accept, parse, and model scanned passport data sent by the client. Then I sent a request to an existing API detailing what needs to be updated. This project improved data accuracy by up to 25% and resulted in hours in saved labor, which would have been used on updating the records manually. 

Throughout the internship, our team practiced Agile and Scrum in 2 week sprints and I was able to contribute in daily stand-ups, code reviews, and design workshops. I also emphasized writing a set of robust unit tests for every new feature I implemented.
