# Experience
## NetJets
### Software Engineering Intern, Crew Innovation Lab
#### June 2020 - Aug. 2020
Last Summer, I was given the opportunity to join the Software Development team at NetJet's Crew Innovation Lab. We worked on improving and maintaining the all-encompassing mobile application flight crew used to view schedules, order food, scan passports and dozens of other things.

Most of my time was spent designing and implementing a way to automatically update discrepancies between passport data scanned from the crew's mobile app during flight boarding and what was stored in our database. I was able to update the appâ€™s back-end architecture using Grails, Groovy, and Java to accept, parse, and model scanned passport data sent by the client. Then I sent a request to an existing API detailing what needs to be updated. This project improved data accuracy by up to 25% and resulted in hours in saved labor, which would have been used on updating the records manually. 

Throughout the internship, our team practiced Agile and Scrum in 2 week sprints and I was able to contribute in daily stand-ups, code reviews, and design workshops. I also emphasized writing a set of robust unit tests for every new feature I implemented.
